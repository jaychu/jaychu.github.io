Hi there and welcome to my first blog post! The objective of this blog will be for me to talk about some cool things I'm currently working on recreationally and share the knowledge I've acquired as a result of this experiment. And the first thing I'll be covering? This exact blog. 

Created using Jekyll and completely run on github pages, I wanted to experiment on the very limits of github pages (especially since it's completely free with no database required!). The result has been interesting thus far.
